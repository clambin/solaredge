Go client for SolarEdge power inverters.

Note: v2 is a re-implementation of the original client. The main aim of the rewrite is to improve testability of clients. 
It is, however, still an implementation of the SolarEdge v1 API.

## Limitations

The following sections of the API have not yet been implemented:

- Account List API
- Meters API
- Sensors API
